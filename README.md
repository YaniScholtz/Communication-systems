# Digital Communication Systems

This repository contains three practical projects for the **Digital Communication Systems** course.  
Each practical explores different concepts like compression, modulation, coding, and channel equalization.

---

## Practical 1: Compression and Modulation Basics

- **Prac1.py**
- Implements:
  - Lempel-Ziv compression and decompression.
  - Huffman coding and decoding.
  - Basic modulation mapping (BPSK, 4QAM, 8PSK, 16QAM).

---

## Practical 2: Channel Equalization and Detection

- **Prac2.py**
- Implements:
  - Assisting functions for bit/symbol conversions.
  - DFE (Decision Feedback Equalization) and MLSE (Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation) algorithms.
  - Static and dynamic channel simulations.
  - SER (Symbol Error Rate) and BER (Bit Error Rate) calculations.

## Practical 3: Error Control Coding

- **Prac3.py**
- Implements:
  - Linear Block Codes encoding and decoding.
  - Long sequence encoding and decoding.
  - Analysis of error correction capabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- No external libraries beyond built-in and numpy required.

To install numpy:

```bash
pip install numpy
